void UpdateFile(char *path1, char *path2, int filesize)

This function is responsible for updating given file. It also decides based on "filesize" variable
whether it delegates the update to SwapSmall or SwapBig function.

	-- char *path1 - Path to the file based on which the other file is updated.
			 This file is also a part in decision of whether to use SwapSmall
			 or SwapBig function.

	-- char *path2 - Path to the file that is being updated.

	-- int filesize - Variable based on wchich the function decides whether file is
			  small or big, if size of the file is lower or equal to this value
			  SwapSmall function is executed, otherwise SwapBig is executed.

bool CheckIfChanged(char *path1, char *path2)

This function compares 2 files based on their modification time. If the file from path1
has been modified after file from path2 then the function returns "true", otherwise "false" is
returned.

	-- char *path1 - Path to the first file.

	-- char *path2 - path to the second file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void SwapSmall(char *path1, char *path2)

This funcion is responsible for updating file from path2 to the state of a file from path1.
The update is done by overwriting the file from path2.

	-- char *path1 - Path to the file that is being used to update.

	-- char *path2 - Path to the file that is being updated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void SwapBig(char *path1, char *path2)

This funcion is responsible for updating file from path2 to the state of a file from path1.
The update is done by mapping both files, truncating file from path2 to the size of a file from path1
and then copying mapped values from file in path1 to the mapped values in the file from path2.

	-- char *path1 - Path to the file that is being used to update.

	-- char *path2 - Path to the file that is being updated.

void Handler(int signum)

This function used to handle SIGUSR1 signal.

	-- int signum - Signal indentificator.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
void Compare(char *path1, char *path2, bool recursion, int filesize)

This function is responsible for updating directory in path2 to the state of directory path1. If the 
variable "recursion", is set to "true", then the function works recusivly and is executed for every 
directory inside the initial directories. It also forwards the "filesize" variable to the update 
executing functions.

	-- char *path1 - Path of the directory based on which the update is executed.

	-- char *path2 - Path of the directory that is being updated.

	-- bool recursion - Variable that states whether the function should be called recursively.

	-- int filesize - Variable based on wchich program decides whether the file is
			  small or big, if size of the file is lower or equal to this value
			  SwapSmall function is executed, otherwise SwapBig is executed.

void Delete(char *path)

This function takes care of deleting files and directories.

	-- char *path - Path to the file or directory that is to be deleted.
